# YT-Screen-Cleaner
When you pause a video in YouTube, the video controls (the Play button, the progress bar, the settings gear, etc.) will appear over the video (partially obstructing it) and they won't go away. So, you pause a coding tutorial to read code that's very small (because the tutorial was recorded in a gigantic screen) and is only on-screen for a second, but oops! the video controls obstruct just the part you want to see...

This extension allows you to toggle (turn ON or turn OFF) the visibility of YouTube video controls. You can do so by clicking the extension's action (the extension's button in your browser's toolbar) or with the command `Ctrl + Delete`; you can change the command by following this path in your browser: <b>Extensions > Manage extensions > Keyboard shortcuts</b>.

If you know of another site whose video controls obstruct the video when you pause and the controls won't go away unless you play the video again, please let me know by submitting an issue here in GitHub, and I'll try to make the extension work for that site too.
